FINAL PROJECT

A design portfolio

To hightlight the 9-12 best samples of my professional and recent student design work. The portfolio should present me as a competent problem solver with diverse skills in both print and web. The aesthetic should portray my personality, if possible, and not distract from the work samples. The goal of the content of this website porfolio is to persuade potential employers to hire me.
Categories of work might include: branding and identity, website design, illustration.
